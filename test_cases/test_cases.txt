Just a little document outlining how I tested my application.

1. Creating an image
- fill out form fields and upload sample image
- click "submit"
- image should be displayed along with creator name, time stamp and title

2. Editing an image
- click the ... button on an image
- form fields should automatically be populated with creator name and title of appropiate image
- click "submit"
- image creator name and title should reflect changes

3. Deleting an image
- click the delete button on an image
- check mongoDB database and ensure object is removed

3. Fetching images
- ensure you have image object on database
- restart client side server
- ensure all image objects are appropiately displayed upon start up
